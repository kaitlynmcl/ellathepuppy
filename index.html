            <p>Hello world! My name is Ella. I'm a mini dachshund and I reside in Philadelphia, PA. My favorite store is Doggy Style&trade; and my favorite food is peanut butter. My mom's name is Megan and she takes really good care of me. Some times she even give me treats like Swedish Fish and ice cream!  </p>

            
                
           <h2> My Family:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Megan, my mom</li>
                <li>Bryan, my dad</li>
                <li>Kaitlyn, my godmother</li>
                <li>Ryan, my uncle</li>
                <li>Madison, my aunt</li>
                <li>Kara, my other aunt</li>

            </ul>

            <p>
                Some things I like to do are chew on my stick, follow my mom around, and jump on people! I also really like to cuddle and fall asleep on people I love, like my godmother. She wrote this page for me because she's my #1 fan. You can find me in Rittenhouse Square where I'm really friendly and like to chase the birds. I'd love to meet you! 
            </p>
